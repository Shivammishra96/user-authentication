# user-authentication
this is simple user authentication system using id and password.
For storing the users data ,we have used Mysql database.
Apache server is used here.
Backened used here is PHP.
Front-end design is developed using HTML,CSS and Javascript.
User are required to register first so that they can be authenticanted later.
The password they will enter is encypted through AES encryptions.
Their data will be securely entered in our database.
the system will verify them whether they are authorised aor not by matching the data within database.
If their data is matched the system authenticate the user as a valid user,if not matched their authentication will be failed.
